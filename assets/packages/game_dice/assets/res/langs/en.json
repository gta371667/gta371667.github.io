                "description7": "With a virtual 100-side dice to roll, players can set the Roll Over/Roll Under amount which acts as a target for players to hit and win a round - controlling the Multiplier and Win Chance during a virtual roll of the dice in a betting round.",
                "description8": "As the name implies, if players are in Roll Over mode, the aim is for the dice to hit the value higher than the Roll Over amount. For Roll Under it is vice versa - the game aims to roll a winning number lower than the Roll Under amount.",
                "description9": "Players can see their expected profit on a winning Dice roll with the game interface based on their betting amount (Default: Happy Point) and how high the multiplier applies on a win based on the volatility set by the Roll Over/Roll Under target.",
                "description10": "Setting the Roll Over amount higher increases the multiplier and payout on big wins, but also decreases the odds of winning a betting round, with the amount set to 50.50 for a clean 2x multiplier by default. Roll Over and Roll Under can be toggled at any time before betting.",
